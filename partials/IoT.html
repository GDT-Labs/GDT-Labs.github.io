<h3>Incident Management System</h3>
<p>The IMS is a custom, purpose built solution demonstrating the integration of edge sensors, such a temperature, humidity and vibration with a message broker to distribute that data to analytics platforms of choice. Those platforms can then make intelligent decisions on how to respond to data anomalies. GDT has built a monitoring tool that will detect incidents, create a Spark room for critical team members to collaborate, and feed real time information about the incident into the Spark room. Additionally, the IMS will open a ServiceNow ticket to capture all information that is being generated in the Spark room. Once the incident is resolved, the Spark room is disbanded and the ServiceNow ticket is closed.</p>
